            <h3>Easy Tourist App (Flutter, PHP, MySQL)</h3>
            <p>
              I developed the Easy Tourist App using Flutter, integrating a PHP
              and MySQL back-end to store vital information such as points of
              interest, directions, and user reviews. The app features offline
              map functionality and a recommendation system tailored to user
              preferences. Through code optimization, I successfully reduced the
              app's loading time by 2 seconds, enhancing overall user
              experience.

            <h3>Gym Website (HTML5, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL)</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a responsive gym website using HTML5, CSS, and
              JavaScript, with a PHP and MySQL back end. The site features
              online services like appointment scheduling and class
              registration, and includes a membership plan comparison tool that
              increased user engagement by 15%.

            <h3>E-Commerce Web Platform</h3>
            <p>
              I developed a dynamic e-commerce web platform using React.js for
              the front-end. The site allows users to register, list their
              products for sale, edit their profiles and product details, browse
              and view detailed descriptions and images of available products,
              and place purchase orders directly through the platform.
